## Bio

Frank Denbow is a Christian artist, DJ, dancer, CS (computer scientist) and entrepreneur from New Jersey. He is currently a Startup Advocate at  [Microsoft for Startups](https://aka.ms/mfsmain) , helping lead Microsoft’s engagement with the startup community in the United States. He served on Microsoft’s COVID-19 task force helping serve companies like  [Luminare](http://luminaremed.com/) . Prior he founded  [INK’A](http://inka.io/) , a platform for producing top quality custom apparel for companies and influencers. Frank bootstrapped INK’A into millions in revenue (and felt all the pains as well, read about it  [here](https://inflectioncommunity.com/blog/if-your-dreams-dont-serve-you-let-them-go) ) and enjoys supporting other entrepreneurs in the startup ecosystem.

Born in Harlem, and raised by Jamaican & Guyanese parents in New Jersey, Frank caught the bug for entrepreneurship at an early age, selling cologne on eBay, and began programming in middle school. A graduate of Carnegie Mellon’s Computer Science program, Frank interned as a software developer at Apple before building his own companies. He  [crossed paths with Steve Jobs](https://frankdenbow.com/my-steve-jobs-story/)  a few times and it left a lasting impression.

Art has always been a part of Frank’s life, as a dancer (reel  [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbVOQIFQnhw&list=PL64F69BC6E6922A4C) ) and paper artist (following in his mother’s footsteps as she runs  [Joy With Paper](http://joywithpaper/) ). He posts some of his art explorations at  [MakeArt.Daily](https://instagram.com/makeart.daily) . Coupling his artistic interests with his background as a technologist, he helped craft events like  [Tech & Culture SXSW](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL0NwqdSsyQMwtk1-wU3XxSJlyEk7dxI3)  in 2019 and  [Tech & Culture February 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSSRnCXb4nk)  in partnership with  [Fueled By Culture](http://fueledbyculture.com/) .

Frank has held leadership positions in community organizations such as First Presbyterian Church as the first youth deacon and at Habitat for Humanity in Bergen County as the first youth board member. He also has worked on the Music Startup Meetup, Startup Weekend, Startup Digest, & Coalition for Queens, helping connect entrepreneurs with the resources they need. Out of this desire, he created  [INFLECTION](http://inflectioncommunity.co/) , a community for profitable companies, which was featured in the  [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/technology/start-ups-rejecting-venture-capital.html) . Frank taught the  [“Introduction to NYC Startup Community”](https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/frank-denbow/260)  course at  [General Assembly](https://ga.co/)  and consults on product marketing with collaborator  [Annie Maguire](http://anniemaguire.com/)  under  [Sage Labs](http://sagelabs.co/) .

An (extremely) amateur model & actor, Frank has done campaigns for  [Under Armour](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/z89lasvkxtomfa5/AABZlBvGSFB-wSvCbPDOzJKca?dl=0) ,  [Land Rover](https://www.instagram.com/p/BZyynL0D8XD)  and  [Choze](https://frankdenbow.com/about-me/) has a pasion for video editing and production (earliest music video can be seen [here]).

With passions for spreading computer science education and in affecting change in prison reform, Frank serves on the advisory board for  [Academy For Software Engineering](http://afsenyc.org/)  (a Computer Science focused high school) & volunteers with organizations like  [Defy Ventures](http://defyventures.org/) .
